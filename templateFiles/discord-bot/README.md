## Development Guide

### Creating a command

To create a new command, you can simply create a new TypeScript file in the `commands` folder. You can use whatever name you like. See `echo.ts` as an example.

### Creating an event

To create a new event, see the [Discord.JS Client documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client) for available events and create a new TypeScript file in the `events` folder with event name. For example: `createInteraction.ts` or `ready.ts`.

## Requirements

- An editor with TypeScript support ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) is recommended.
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v16.9 or higher)

## Getting started

1. `<package manager install>`
2. add the token to [`.env`](.env)
   > if you don't, the bot will error and ask you to add it.<br/>
   > btw the bot needs `applications.commands`
3. `<package manager run> dev`
